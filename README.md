## Welcome to the Emergence Art Project

Emergence Art is a collaborative initiative that provides Emergence 3D assets to creators in our fan base and beyond. Our goal is to let you "play with our toys" - giving you the tools to create games, short films, and other creative content using assets from the Emergence universe.

## Project Goals

- **Democratize Access**: Make Emergence 3D assets accessible to creators
- **Inspire Creativity**: Encourage the creation of games, short films, and other content set in the Emergence universe
- **Foster Community**: Build a vibrant community of creators who expand and enrich the Emergence universe
- **Expand the Lore**: Enable the creation of new characters, settings, and stories within the Emergence universe

## Getting Started

1. Check out https://www.emergenceuniverse.com/world-bible to learn about the Emergence universe
2. Explore the asset catalog to see what's available here: https://github.com/adimverse/emergence-art
3. Set up your preferred DCC tool to use the assets
