# The Emergence Universe: A Primer

Created by **David S. Goyer**

## Overview

Welcome to the world of Emergence, a science fiction universe set in a distant corner of the cosmos where civilizations discover powerful alien artifacts known as RELICS. These mysterious objects propel species to the stars, unlocking tremendous power—but they also corrupt minds and plunge the galaxy into conflict.

This guide provides a brief introduction to the key elements of the Emergence universe to help creators understand the world they'll be working with.

## The White Fountain

At the center of this galaxy lies a WHITE FOUNTAIN—the luminous opposite of a black hole. While black holes consume matter and energy beyond a point of no return, white fountains cast it out. Nothing may enter a white fountain, and strange phenomena occur at its boundaries.

The White Fountain periodically ejects alien artifacts called RELICS, objects of immense power that appear to have been created by an earlier or "higher" civilization known as THE MAKERS.

## Relics

Relics are mysterious objects that don't correspond to anything on the periodic table and seem to defy the known laws of physics. They are inherently unpredictable, and many encounters with them end in tragedy. Despite the high risk, the revolutionary knowledge and power they provide have enabled intelligent species to explore, expand, and dominate vast regions of the galaxy.

Major relic breakthroughs include:
- Faster-than-light travel
- Hyper-evolution
- Alchemy (transmutation of elements)
- Ultrawave communication
- Ghost-speaking (communication with the past)

## The Advanced Three

Three sapient species discovered relics on their homeworlds and unlocked their power, uplifting themselves to become the dominant civilizations in the galaxy:

### The Kind

Essentially human in appearance, the Kind have transformed their entire system into a machine—themselves included. They're governed by a centralized mega-corporate entity and have created genetically modified subspecies: WIDES (for high-gravity worlds) and WISPS (for low-gravity worlds).

The Kind are the wealthiest species, selling products generated from relic research to any species in the galaxy. They believe the relics are precious resources that must be collected and controlled.

### The Shard

Cephalopods with six arms capable of changing colors for expression and communication. The Shard developed on a rogue planet that no longer orbits a star. They're a religious civilization with three castes: the ruling Exarchs, the Crusaders, and the monks.

The Shard believe the ELDER BEINGS (their name for the Makers) sent the relics as a test. They consider relic collection a holy endeavor and believe when collective grace is achieved throughout the galaxy, it will herald the return of the Elder Beings.

### The Ghast

Towering creatures with fearsome appearances resembling a combination of a mandrill and a skull. The Ghast evolved in the twilight band of a tidally locked world and are organized in a matriarchal, militaristic society.

The Ghast consume the brains of their forebears in ritualistic ceremonies, taking on their ancestors' memories and quest burdens. By studying the relics, Ghast society was able to radically depart from tradition, embrace technology, and expand into a multi-planetary empire.

## The Galactic Situation

The Advanced Three are locked in a deadly race to gain dominance over the other societies, conquer the galaxy, and become a Type III civilization. Each species knows that control of the relics will determine their society's ascendance or extinction.

Relic hunting has become the coin of the realm, with each civilization deploying SURVEY TEAMS to scour their spheres of influence for undiscovered relics. There are also FREEBOOTERS—freelancers and corsairs operating on the fringes who sell their discoveries to the highest bidder.

## Key Locations

### Fountainview

A research station orbiting the boundary of the White Fountain, staffed by scientists from all three Advanced Races. Anyone who lives at Fountainview undergoes a natural—and permanent—transformation of their DNA due to proximity to the Fountain, making them genetically incompatible with their original species.

### Vitapax Stations

Fully automated refueling stations throughout the galaxy where ships can berth for refueling, repairs, and hiring crew. These stations are also lawless areas governed by corrupt port authorities, rife with illicit activities.

## Notable Characters

### Captain Skadi

A human who survived first contact with a relic that crystallized her entire home planet. Her hand was transformed into crystal, making her immune to relic effects. After being held captive for hundreds of years by Fountainview researchers, she escaped and became the captain of a relic-hunting ship called THE BELLEROPHON ("The Belle").

Skadi's crew has located more relics than any other group, but unlike other hunters, she doesn't sell her finds. Instead, she has her own agenda: to break through the White Fountain and confront the Makers about the death of her family.

### Other Key Characters

- **BL1P**: Skadi's hovering bot companion, a gift from her parents
- **Hyrax**: An orphaned Kind raised by the Ghast
- **Krokus the Gloom**: A legendary Ghast warrior
- **Sitra of the Driad**: A teenager who discovers a relic fragment
- **The Bishop of Blades**: A Shard Crusader and master swordsman
- **A.T.L.A.S.**: Fountainview's central computing unit

## Storytelling in the Emergence Universe

The custom of storytelling has become woven into the fabric of the galaxy. Whenever strangers meet—whether on an asteroid, a spaceship, or at a rest station—they trade stories by firelight, a hallowed ritual shared by almost every intelligent race. For many weary travelers, these stories provide the only sense of home they have.
