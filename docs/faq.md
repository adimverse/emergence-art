## General Questions

### What is Emergence Art?

Emergence Art is a collaborative initiative that provides Emergence 3D assets to creators in the Epic community and beyond. Our goal is to let you "play with our toys" - giving you the tools to create games, short films, and other creative content using assets from the Emergence universe.

### Who can use these assets?

Anyone! The assets are available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0), which means you can use them for personal and commercial projects as long as you provide attribution to the Emergence project.

### Do I need to pay to use these assets?

No, all assets provided through this repository are free to use under the CC BY 4.0 license.

### What is the Emergence universe?

Emergence is a science fiction universe set in a distant corner of the cosmos where civilizations discover powerful alien artifacts known as RELICS. These mysterious objects propel species to the stars, unlocking tremendous powerâ€”but they also corrupt minds and plunge the galaxy into conflict. See the [World Guide](./world-guide.md) for more details.
