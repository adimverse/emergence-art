# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is Emergence Open?

Emergence Open is a collaborative initiative that provides Emergence 2D and 3D assets to creators. Our goal is to let you "play with our toys" - giving you the tools to create games, short films, VR/AR and other creative content using assets from the Emergence universe.

### Who can use these assets?

Anyone! This first batch of assets is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0), which means you can use them for personal and commercial projects as long as you provide attribution to the Emergence project. See Lisence for details.

### Do I need to pay to use these assets?

No, all assets provided through this repository are free to use under the CC BY 4.0 license.

### What is the Emergence universe?

Emergence was created by renowned filmmaker David S. Goyer (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Blade Trilogy, Man of Steel, Foundation). It is a science fiction universe set in a distant corner of the cosmos where civilizations discover powerful alien artifacts known as RELICS. These mysterious objects propel species to the stars, unlocking tremendous power—but they also corrupt minds and plunge the galaxy into conflict. See the [World Bible, 2nd Edition](world-bible-2ndEdition.md) for more details.
