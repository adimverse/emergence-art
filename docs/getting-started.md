# Getting Started with Emergence Open

Welcome to the Emergence Art project! This guide will help you get started with using the Emergence assets in your creative projects.

[PRELIMINARY ACTUAL INSTRUCTIONS COMING SOON]

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

1. A compatible Digital Content Creation (DCC) tool:
   - Unreal Engine
   - Blender
   - Maya
   - Godot
   - Or another compatible tool

2. Basic knowledge of your chosen DCC tool
3. Git installed on your computer (for cloning this repository)
4. Sufficient storage space for the assets you plan to use

## Setting Up

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/emergence-art.git
cd emergence-art
```

### 2. Choose Your DCC Tool

Navigate to the appropriate pipeline folder for your chosen DCC tool:

```
/pipelines/unreal/   # For Unreal Engine
/pipelines/blender/  # For Blender
/pipelines/maya/     # For Maya
/pipelines/godot/    # For Godot
```

Each folder contains specific instructions and tools for integrating Emergence assets with that particular DCC.

### 3. Install Required Plugins/Extensions

Follow the installation instructions in the README file within your chosen pipeline folder to set up any required plugins or extensions.

### 4. Access the Assets

All Emergence assets are hosted on AWS and referenced via URLs in this repository. The pipeline tools will help you download and work with these assets efficiently.

## Asset Categories

Emergence assets are organized into several categories:

1. **Characters**: Models, rigs, and animations for characters from the Emergence universe
2. **Environments**: Sets, terrain, and world-building elements
3. **Props**: Items, weapons, technology, and other objects
4. **VFX**: Visual effects associated with relics and technology
5. **Textures**: Materials and texture maps
6. **Audio**: Sound effects and atmospheric elements

## Working with Assets

### Best Practices

1. **Start small**: Begin with a few assets to understand how they work in your chosen DCC
2. **Check compatibility**: Make sure the assets you're using are compatible with your DCC version
3. **Experiment**: Don't be afraid to modify assets to fit your creative vision
4. **Optimize**: Consider the performance implications of high-detail assets in your project

### Creating New Content

When creating new content with Emergence assets, consider:

1. **Universe consistency**: Try to maintain consistency with the established lore
2. **Attribution**: Remember to credit the Emergence project in your work
3. **Sharing**: Consider sharing your creations with the community

## Examples

Check out the `/examples/` folder for sample projects demonstrating how to use Emergence assets in different DCCs:

```
/examples/unreal/   # Unreal Engine examples
/examples/blender/  # Blender examples
/examples/maya/     # Maya examples
/examples/godot/    # Godot examples
```

## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the FAQ in the documentation
2. Look for similar issues in the GitHub Issues
3. Ask for help in the community forum or Discord
4. Create a new issue on GitHub if you've found a new problem

## Next Steps

Now that you're set up, here are some next steps:

1. Read the [World Guide](./world-guide.md) to understand the Emergence universe
2. Explore the asset catalog to see what's available
3. Check out the examples for inspiration
4. Join the community and share your work!

Happy creating!
